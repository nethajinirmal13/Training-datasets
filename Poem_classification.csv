Affection,"It flares up at sunrise, a blush in a bramble Tumbling out of its bed by the city pavement—a single Rose, coral heat, at the end of the season."
Affection,"It was easy enough to bend them to my wish, it was easy enough to alter them with a touch, but you adrift on the great sea, how shall I call you back?Cedar and white ash, rock-cedar and sand plants and tamarisk red cedar and white cedar and black cedar from the inmost forest, fragrance upon fragrance and all of my sea-magic"
Affection,"It's all I have to bring today—This, and my heart beside—This, and my heart, and all the fields—And all the meadows wide—Be sure you count—should I forgetSome one the sum could tell—This, and my heart, and all the BeesWhich in the Clover dwell."
Affection,"It's not the first time we've bitten into a peach. But now at the same time it splits--half for each. Our ""then"" is inside its ""now,"" its halved pit unfleshed--what was refreshed. Two happinesses unfold from one joy, folioed. In a hotel room our moment lies with its ode inside, a red tinge, with a hinge."
Affection,"It’s the last few hours of a county fair, or the ninth inning, score tied, in a small-town high school big game, everything that’s going to happen destined to feel inevitable. Everett’s favorite cow has yet to win a prize, and what occurs next on the field will likely determine whether a certain boy, years later,"
Affection,"Lay your sleeping head, my love, Human on my faithless arm; Time and fevers burn away Individual beauty from Thoughtful children, and the grave Proves the child ephemeral: But in my arms till break of day Let the living creature lie, Mortal, guilty, but to me The entirely beautiful.Soul and body have no bounds: To lovers as they lie upon Her"
Affection,"Let me not to the marriage of true mindsAdmit impediments. Love is not loveWhich alters when it alteration finds,Or bends with the remover to remove:O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,That looks on tempests and is never"
Affection,"Light drifts across the ceiling as if we are under water—whoever would approach you you changed the comerYou holding on to the front of my coat with both hands, the last time I saw you—I felt your death coming close —the change in your red lipsYou gave me your hand. You pulled me out of"
Affection,"LINES WRITTEN TO AN ALBUM PRINT.As on this pictured page I look, This pretty tale of line and hook As though it were a novel-book Amuses and engages: I know them both, the boy and girl; She"
Affection,"Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,    Where that comes in that shall not go again;Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate.    They have known shame, who love unloved. Even then,When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,    And agony’s forgot, and hushed the cryingOf"
Affection,Love remains a kind of present tense. This is how we describe the scenes in photographs—as though the actions in them were still happening. My father is throwing a rock in this picture. My father keeps lions in his chest & they rip apart a gazelle in this picture.A man
Affection,"Love, though for this you riddle me with darts,     And drag me at your chariot till I die—Oh, heavy prince! oh, panderer of hearts!—     Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lieWho shout you mighty: thick about my hair,     Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr,Who still"

Environment," LINES WRITTEN IN THE VALE OF CHAMOUNIThe everlasting universe of things Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, Now dark—now glittering—now reflecting gloom— Now lending splendour, where from secret springs The source of human thought its tribute brings Of waters,—with a sound but half its own, Such as a feeble brook"

Environment,"Arriving with throats like nipped roses, like a tiny bloom fastened to each neck, nothing else cuts the air quite like this thrum to make the small dog at my feet whine and yelp. So we wait—no excitement pinned to the sky so needled and our days open full of rain for weeks. Nothing yet"
Environment,"As in green, vert, a royal demesne     stocked with deer. Invert as in tippedas a snow globe, going nowhere in circlesbut not lost, not bereft as the woodwithout deer, waiting for the white antleredbuck, or his does, or any slim yearlingto step along the berm, return. Vertigoas in whirling round,"
Environment,"Behold that Tree, in Autumn’s dim decay, Stript by the frequent, chill, and eddying Wind; Where yet some yellow, lonely leaves we find Lingering and trembling on the naked spray,Twenty, perchance, for millions whirl'd away! Emblem, alas!"
Environment,"Five years have past; five summers, with the length Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur.—Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, That on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect The landscape with the quiet of"
Environment,"I have been a spendthrift Dropping from lazy fingers Quiet coloured hours, Fluttering away from me Like oak and beech leaves in October.I have lived keenly and wastefully, Like a bush or a sun insect— Lived sensually and thoughtfully, Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world— Green ivy about ruined towers, The out-pouring of the grey sea, And"
Environment,"I wandered lonely as a Cloud   That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,   A host of golden Daffodils;Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shine   And twinkle on the Milky Way,They stretched in never-ending line   Along the margin"
Environment,"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made: Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee; And live alone in the bee-loud glade.And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, Dropping from the veils"
Environment,"Is this a time to be cloudy and sad, When our mother Nature laughs around; When even the deep blue heavens look glad, And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground?There are notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren, And the gossip of swallows through all the sky; The ground-squirrel gaily chirps by his den, And"
Environment,"Just like as in a nest of boxes round, Degrees of sizes in each box are found: So, in this world, may many others be Thinner and less, and less still by degree: Although they are not subject to our sense, A world may be no bigger than two-pence. Nature is curious, and such works may"
Environment,Love me stupid. Love me terrible. And when I am no mountain but rather a monsoon of imperfect thunder love me. When I am blue in my face from swallowing myself yet wearing my best heart even if my best heart is a century of hunger an angry mule breathing hard or perhaps even hopeful. A small sun. Little & bright.
Environment,"Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;And o'er their spirits"

Environment,"To pick a tulip from the garden, the red one. To put it on the desk In the small blue vase, here. No, Here.To incline toward it then, as if the flower could teach me something Of its art.Of my own art. When did we forget"
Environment,"We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver, Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings Give various response to each varying blast, To whose frail frame no"
Environment,"When pulled, the spider web took another form.The bull’s-eye relaxed, the bull unseen but felt,skull on muscle paused on the forest floor.The girl said oh, as she had heard her mothersay before.
